			<p>I am from Los Gatos, California. I studied mechanical engineering at Santa Barbara City College. I took time off after my first two years of college in order to travel and teach kiteboarding and snowboading. In the last 2 and a half years I've lived in the Sierras of California, the sinking sandbars of North Carolina's Outer Banks and the beach-side city of Dorado in beautiful Puerto Rico. Although I enjoyed and excelled at mechanical engineering, I quickly realized the career paths an M.E. degree would offer did not align with my needs. After reevaluating my goals I've decided to pivot into full-stack web development.</p>
